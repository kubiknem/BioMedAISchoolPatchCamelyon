# TODO: Create the configuration for the train dataset.
#   - Don't forget to include proper transforms - import it
#   - The path for the images is:
#       /mnt/data/PatchCamelyon/camelyonpatch_level_2_split_valid_x.npy
#   - The path for the labels is:
#       /mnt/data/PatchCamelyon/camelyonpatch_level_2_split_valid_y.npy
# In case you have no idea what to write here, have a look at the other configuration files
